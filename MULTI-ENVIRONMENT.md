# Multi-environment use

For people who are very new to Flux or Gitops, you might say to yourself, 
"Okay, the demo is cool and all, but how do I use flux in multiple environments (dev/qa/prod) ?"

I have a demo for that too! But I figured the main README was too long, so I split it out to here.

Take a look at [clusters/ppbrown-qa](clusters/ppbrown-qa) to see how you can make a QA or other alternative environment that
is primarily based on a main one, with a few tweaks.
